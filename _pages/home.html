  Camp 2021

  <a href="{% link _pages/registration.html %}">Registration is now open for Millburg!</a>

<h1>Our purpose</h1>
<p>
  From April to October of each year, Berrien County teems with Mexicans who
  come to work a seasonal agricultural job. We focus on teaching the Word of
  God to these Migrant families so that they might hear the Gospel, believe on
  the Lord Jesus, and be discipled in their new life with Christ.
